Simple drill program for rote memorization

This is just a quick & dirty script that I threw together one day to practice vocabulary words for a Spanish class, and I used it for that and some other classes needing rote memorization as well.  It was crude, ugly code and completely uncommented because it was just a quick hack to get the job done, but it worked quite well in practice.
